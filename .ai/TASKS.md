# PawVault Tasks

## Phase 1: App skeleton, routing, theme, DI placeholder, Firebase-ready setup

- [x] Create feature-based folder structure under `lib/features`.
- [x] Add Bloc/Cubit dependency and initial Cubits for placeholder flows.
- [x] Add AutoRoute dependency and route definitions.
- [x] Create placeholder screens for pet list, pet profile, timeline, documents,
  reminders, smart input, and vet summary export.
- [x] Add light and dark theme shell.
- [x] Add dependency injection placeholder with repository providers.
- [x] Add Firebase-ready dependencies for Auth, Firestore, Storage, Core, and AI
  Logic.
- [x] Add Firebase-ready app options and platform config files.
- [x] Add Firebase-ready auth, storage, Firestore, and AI data source adapters.
- [x] Add autonomous agent workflow files: `AGENTS.md`, `.ai/ROADMAP.md`,
  `.ai/TASKS.md`, `.ai/PLANS.md`, and README workflow notes.
- [x] Review Phase 1 architecture boundaries and remove any accidental feature
  behavior beyond placeholders.
- [x] Confirm project-level Codex MCP config works, or document the required
  global MCP config if project-level config is not picked up.

## Phase 2: Domain models and Firebase contracts

- [x] Review domain entities against `PawVault_MVP_Spec_Firebase_Gemini.md`.
- [x] Add missing value objects/enums for IDs, dates, event types, document
  types, reminder repeat types, and AI draft statuses where useful.
- [ ] Expand repository interfaces with read/write method contracts, without
  implementing Firebase behavior yet.
- [ ] Add model mapping plan for Firestore documents and timestamps.
- [ ] Add focused tests for value objects, pure model code, or mapping code once
  mappings exist.
